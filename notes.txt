Install TypeScript
npm install typescript --save-dev -> this will install typescript locally for the project and save as dev dependency.
after installing typescript to compile typescript use 
tsc -> this will compile the typescript files to javascript
use npx tsc if typescript is installed locally since regular tsc command won't work

--watch can be added to run in watch mode so changes are auto-compiled
npx tsc --watch


Initialize a config file
npx tsc --init
This will create a tsconfig.json file where settings like output directory or targets or other rules can be changed or configured.
