# TypeScript and JavaScript Learning Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you learn TypeScript and JavaScript from the basics to more advanced concepts. Follow the learning path in order, or jump to any topic that interests you.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the language concepts, make sure your project is set up correctly.

1. **[Initial Steps](./initial-step.md)** - Set up TypeScript, configure your project, and learn how to run it.

## Fundamentals

These are the core concepts you need to understand to write TypeScript and JavaScript code.

2. **[Variables](./variables.md)** - Learn about variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`), data types, and hoisting.

3. **[Type Annotations](./type-annotations.md)** - Understand how to add types to your variables and functions, and how TypeScript infers types automatically.

4. **[Template Strings](./template-strings.md)** - Master string interpolation and multi-line strings using backticks.

## Learning Path

Follow this order for the best learning experience:

```
1. Initial Steps (Setup)
   ↓
2. Variables (Declaration & Data Types)
   ↓
3. Type Annotations (Adding Types)
   ↓
4. Template Strings (String Manipulation)
   ↓
   (More topics coming soon...)
```

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Initial Steps](./initial-step.md) | Project setup, TypeScript compilation, running your code |
| [Variables](./variables.md) | Variable declarations, primitive types, arrays, enums, tuples, hoisting |
| [Type Annotations](./type-annotations.md) | Type syntax, inference, interfaces, unions, return types |
| [Template Strings](./template-strings.md) | String interpolation, expressions, multi-line strings |

## Tips for Learning

- Read each topic completely before moving to the next
- Practice the examples by typing them into your `app.ts` file
- Run `npm run build` to compile and execute your code
- Experiment by modifying the examples and seeing what happens
- Use the navigation links at the bottom of each page to move between topics
